        <p>My Story
            A Personal Finance Blog Worth Reading
            ~Kiplinger Magazine
            
            Welcome to 20somethingfinance! My name is G.E. Miller. I am the founder, owner, and sole author of this independent personal finance site. Long story short: I went from zero savings and significant debt after graduation, to saving over 85% of my income in just a few years, without a huge income. In under 2 decades, I reached financial independence status and I’ve chronicled my journey on this site.
            
            20somethingfinance is now 15+ years old and has become one of the most popular personal finance sites in the world. If you’re new here, you can find every post in the archives and subscribe to get all new articles sent to you, for free.
            
            Also – don’t let the name of the site scare you off. If you’re not in your 20s, I no longer am either (but the site is stuck with the name), and 50%+ of the readers here are over age 30. Personal finance success is an ageless pursuit.
            
            Now, on to the more detailed and dramatic story on why this site exists…
            
            The Best Years?
            I have had some good luck and privilege along the way, but nothing has come easy. I grew up in a lower middle class, one-income family. I studied hard and worked my way through public schools. I worked throughout high school and college to help pay my way through a public university.
            
            tired
            
            I graduated college firmly into a recession, with a business B.A. from Michigan State University. After 300+ applications, I finally hit the workforce and started making just $30k per year while working 50-60+ hours a week at a job that did not require a college degree. Financially, I had no room to breathe – my cell phone, cable, internet, utility, car, fuel, rent, insurance, credit card, student loan, and food expenses were eating all of my income. I had zero savings to speak of and significant debts.
            
            With no escape in sight, I started to question whether this typical American work-spend-repeat lifestyle to keep up with the latest consumer indulgences was sustainable for me.
            
            Taking Action
            I had to do something. I realized that if I were going to have any shred of enjoyment in life, I needed to veer off of the typical life path. But my finances were holding me back. So what did I do? I started hacking them.
