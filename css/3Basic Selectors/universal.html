                <p>The Tortoise and the Hare

                    This is an extremely popular story about a hare and a tortoise.
                    The hare is an animal that is known to move quickly, while a tortoise is one to move slowly.
                    One day, the hare challenged the tortoise to a race simply to prove that he was the best. The tortoise agreed.
                    Once the race began the hare was easily able to get a head start. Upon realizing that the tortoise is far behind. The overconfident hare decided to take a nap.
                    Meanwhile the tortoise, who was extremely determined and dedicated to the race was slowly nearing the finish line.
                    The tortoise won the race while the hare napped. Most importantly he did it with humility and without arrogance.
