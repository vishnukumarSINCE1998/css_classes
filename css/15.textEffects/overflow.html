        Charan starred in Bommarillu Bhaskar's urban romantic film Orange in 2010 as Ram, a NRI living in Australia.[18]
        Although the film didn't perform well at the box office, critics praised the storyline and performance by
        Charan.[19] Jeevi of Idlebrain felt that Charan didn't tried to stick to stardom and is not willing to repeat
        the mistakes performed by stars.[20] Over the years, it became a cult film and received appreciation from the
        audience.[21] In her article for Film Companion, Alekhya Devarakonda compared his character to Howard Roark of
        1943 novel The Fountainhead.[22] Following a year-long absence from the screen, he next appeared in Racha
        (2012), directed by Sampath Nandi. He played the role of "Betting Raj", a gambler. The film completed a 100-day
        run in 38 centres across Andhra Pradesh on 13 July 2012.[23] Racha's final share for its distributors was ₹45
        crore (US$5.6 million).[24] His performance in the film brought two nominations, including Filmfare Award for
        Best Actor – Telugu and SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu).[25][26] Sify stated, "Both, actor Ram Charan and
        his director Sampath Nandi play a safe game by following the same pattern of earlier mass-masala movies."[27]
        Radhika Rajamani of Rediff criticized the plot of the film, but praised Charan's performance in action sequences
        and dance moves.[28] IndiaGlitz wrote: "He shows flashes of Chiru-ness more than he ever did in the past; be it
        his baritone or demeanor, he is a Megastar in effect. Helped by a strong script, he could have been much
        better."[29] The film was released on 5 April 2012 and was declared a commercial success.[30]
